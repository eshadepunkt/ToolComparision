Current Behaviour in comparision:
    - all tools that do not contain all criteria will be ignored
    - it is possible to compare only one tool (this will result in a negative ranking)
    - when an import was cancelled it is not possible to add new items
        -> not reproducable(?) after fix(?)
            -> (Remark) item was added but add/update button did not redirect. Cancel was possible
